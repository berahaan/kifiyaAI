Utility scripts and helpers for the Solar Data Discovery project live here.

Suggested uses:
- Batch data preparation or cleaning routines.
- Shared plotting utilities for Streamlit or notebooks.
- Command-line entrypoints for automation tasks.

Keep scripts modular and reusable; move complex logic into `src/` where it can be tested.
