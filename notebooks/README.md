This folder keeps exploratory notebooks for the Solar Data Discovery challenge.

- `EDA_IRIS.ipynb`: Template notebook used during setup.
- Add country-specific EDA notebooks on feature branches (e.g., `benin_eda.ipynb`).
- Keep notebooks lightweight; move reusable code into `src/` or `app/` modules.
